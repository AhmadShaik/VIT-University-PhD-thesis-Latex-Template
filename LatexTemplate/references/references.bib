abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Ahmad Shaik et al. High speed communication networks facilitate the simple and rapid mode of online information sharing with high data rates. But the channels which are used for data sharing are not secure. The subject of data security emerges in such scenarios. To achieve this, different security methods are being used in digital communication. Cryptography is one of the popular techniques, but the scrambled appearance of encrypted information can lead to high probability of attacks. Hiding information in a cover is one of the alternatives to cryptography. The main objective of this study is to provide an overall idea about the popular as well as emerging data hiding techniques in spatial and transform domains. This study deals with both reversible and non-reversible data hiding methods. Also, this study briefly discusses some common steganalytic techniques and concludes with an idea of the future scope of Reversible Data Hiding (RDH). The wide range of these techniques will provide a good overview about current trends in transform domain steganography to the researchers who are interested in steganography.},

@incollection{Thanikaiselvan2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.The sharing of digital media over the Internet has given rise to many issues concerning security and privacy of data. While encryption is used to secure the data, the appearance of encrypted images and video streams makes them vulnerable to attacks. This situation can be disastrous in cases where security and privacy are of utmost importance, such as in military, medical, or covert applications. This drawback of cryptography is one of the many factors which encourage research in the field of information hiding. Information hiding aims to protect the integrity of the data during transmission or while in storage. Steganography is a branch of information hiding which conceals the existence of the secret data hidden in a cover medium. This chapter discusses the idea behind information hiding with respect to reversible and non-reversible steganography. It starts with a general introduction about steganography and its classification into spatial and transform domain techniques. This chapter then moves on to give an explanation of the various spatial and transform domain techniques in use today. It then suggests the scope for future developments followed by the conclusion.},
